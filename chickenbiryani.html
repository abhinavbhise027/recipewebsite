    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash the basmati rice under cold water until the water runs clear. Soak the rice in water for 30 minutes,
            then drain.</li>
        <li>In a large pot, heat ghee and oil. Add the whole spices and sauté until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add the sliced onions and sauté until they turn golden brown.</li>
        <li>Add the ginger and garlic paste, and sauté for a minute until the raw smell disappears.</li>
        <li>Add the chopped tomatoes and cook until they soften.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken pieces and cook until they are no longer pink on the outside.</li>
        <li>Add the biryani masala, yogurt, mint leaves, and cilantro. Mix well.</li>
        <li>In a separate pot, bring water to a boil and cook the soaked rice until it's 70% cooked. Drain the rice.
        </li>
        <li>Layer the partially cooked rice over the chicken mixture in the pot.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle saffron-soaked milk, fried onions, mint leaves, and cilantro over the rice.</li>
        <li>Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid and cook on low heat for 20-25 minutes, allowing the rice and chicken
            to cook through and absorb the flavors.</li>
        <li>Turn off the heat and let the biryani rest for 10 minutes before gently fluffing the rice with a fork.</li>
        <li>Serve the chicken biryani hot with raita or salad on the side.</li>
    </ol>
