    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.</li>
        <li>In another bowl, beat the eggs, then add the milk, melted butter, and vanilla extract. Mix well.</li>
        <li>Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. The batter may have some
            lumps; that's okay.</li>
        <li>Preheat a griddle or skillet over medium-high heat. Lightly grease with butter or oil.</li>
        <li>For each pancake, pour about 1/4 cup of batter onto the griddle.</li>
        <li>Cook until bubbles form on the surface, then flip the pancake and cook the other side until golden brown.
        </li>
        <li>Repeat with the remaining batter.</li>
        <li>Serve the pancakes warm with your favorite toppings such as maple syrup, fresh fruit, or whipped cream.</li>
