    <div id="Spinach">
        <p>
            Before you start cooking spinach, you'll want to work with about 1 pound of spinach at a time (it should
            equal about 12 cups torn). It may seem like a lot, but it cooks down to a much smaller volume. Thoroughly
            wash and drain spinach. Remove stems and tear leaves into pieces, as desired. If you're using baby spinach,
            the stems generally do not need to be removed, as they're more tender. You also likely won't need to tear
            the leaves into pieces, because they're already smaller. If you're using prewashed baby spinach, sold in
            bags in the produce aisle, you can skip washing. Each of the following three methods for cooking spinach
            makes 4 side-dish servings.

    <div id="Okra">
        <p>
            Cooking okra over high heat is absolutely the best way to prepare it. And when it comes to heat, deep-frying
            is definitely hot! A deep fryer is ideal for frying okra because it allows you to set and regulate an exact
            frying temperature. However, you can also use a large heavy pan and a deep-fry thermometer to make fried
            okra.

    <div id="pumpkin">
        <p>
            Halve the pumpkin; remove seeds, pulp, and stringy portion. Cut into small pieces and peel. Cover with
            lightly salted water and boil for about 25 minutes, or until tender. Mash, purée in a blender or food
            processor or put through a food mill. Use in any recipe calling for pumpkin purée.
